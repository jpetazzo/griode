# Griode

Griode lets you play music using a LaunchPad or a similar controller.

For short demos and tutorials, check this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBAFXs0YjviK9PzKnr3MDsRU6YAJgeH1K).

This [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16wTihPzhnTIVcAFDvHevtFG-0K0qXPPB)
explains how to switch instruments and modes.
The original version of the poster was made by Jérôme Petazzoni to
present at PyCon in 2019; and it was then much improved
by [Elodie Trinh](https://twitter.com/mintismycolor) (thanks Elodie!♥).

There is also a basic (and incomplete) [user manual](MANUAL.md) that
you may (or not) find helpful.


## Quick start

Here are some quick instructions to get you started, assuming that you
have a LaunchPad connected to an Debian/Ubuntu system.

```
git clone git://github.com/jpetazzo/griode
cd griode
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev libasound2-dev libjack-dev fluidsynth
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
( cd soundfonts; ./download-soundfonts.sh; )
./griode.py
```

Your LaunchPad should light up with a red and white pattern, and pressing
pads should make piano sounds.


### Installing on a Raspberry Pi

If you want to setup Griode on a Raspberry Pi, you can use the
instructions above, but **make sure that you run them as the `pi` user.**

You can use the "lite" (text only) or the "desktop" version, it
doesn't matter for Griode.

If you want Griode to start automatically when the Pi is powered on,
see [this paragraph](#Starting-automatically-on-boot).


## Detailed setup instructions

You need:

- Python 3
- FluidSynth (to generate sounds)
- at least one SoundFont (instrument bank used by FluidSynth)
- a LaunchPad or similar MIDI controller


### Installing Python dependencies

On Debian/Ubuntu systems, you will need the following system packages,
so that the `python-rtmidi` Python package can be installed correctly:

```bash
apt-get install python3-dev libasound2-dev libjack-dev
```

You can then install Griode's requirements with `pip`:

```bash
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

Of course, you are welcome to use `virtualenv` or anything like that
if you want.

If you get compilation errors, you might need extra packages (libraries or headers).

Note: if you have problems related to the installation of `python-rtmidi`,
you might be tempted to try to install `rtmidi` instead. DO NOT! The two
packages are slightly incompatible; so after installing `rtmidi`, perhaps
Griode will start, but you will get another bizarre error at a later point.


### Installing FluidSynth

Fluidsynth is a software synthesizer. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, you
can install it with:

```
apt-get install fluidsynth
```


### Installing SoundFonts

Griode requires at least one "SoundFont" so that FluidSynth can make
sounds. The easiest way to get started is to go to the `soundfonts/`
subdirectory, and run the script `download-soundfonts.sh`.

Griode will load SoundFonts called `?.sf2` in alphabetical order.
The `download-soundfonts.sh` script will create a symlink `0.sf2`
pointing to the "GeneralUser GS" SoundFont, which contains the
128 instruments of the General MIDI standard, as well as a few
variations, and a few drum kits.

You are welcome to download your own soundfonts, place them in
the `soundfonts/` subdirectory, and create symlinks to these files:
they will be loaded when you start Griode.


#### What are soundfonts?

SoundFonts are instrument banks used by some audio hardware and by FluidSynth
to generate notes of music. The typical extension for SoundFont files is `.sf2`.

There are many SoundFonts available out there.
Some of them are tiny: the Sound Blaster AWE32 (a sound card from the mid-90s)
had 512 KB of RAM to load SoundFonts, and there are SoundFonts of that size
that offer the 100+ instruments of the General Midi standard! And some
SoundFonts are huge: I saw some 1 GB SoundFonts out there with just a couple
of piano instruments in them, but in very high quality (i.e. using different
samples for each note and for different velocity levels.)

Here are a few links to some SF2 files:
- [GeneralUser](http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php)
- [Fluid SoundFont](https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/fluid-soundfont)
- [Soundfonts4U](https://sites.google.com/site/soundfonts4u/)
- [8bitsf](https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/23/8bitsf.SF2)

### LaunchPad

Griode currently supports the Launchpad Pro, the Launchpad MK2 (aka "RGB"),
and has partial support for the Launchpad S. You can plug multiple
controllers and use them simultaneously.

Griode relies on the name of the MIDI port reported by the `mido` library
to detect your Launchpad(s). This has been tested on Linux, but the port
names might be different on macOS or Windows.


## Debugging

You can set the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to any valid `logging`
level, e.g. `DEBUG` or `INFO`:

```
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
./griode.py
```

Note:
- `DEBUG` level is (and will always be) very verbose.
- You can put the log level in lowercase if you want.
- The default log level is `INFO`.


### Persistence

Griode saves all persistent information to the `state/` subdirectory.
If you want to reset Griode (or some of its subsystems) to factory defaults,
you can wipe out this directory (or some of the files therein).


### Starting automatically on boot

If you are using a Raspberry Pi running the Raspbian distribution,
and want to automatically start Griode on boot, you can use the provided
systemd unit (`griode.service`).

After checking out the code in `/home/pi/griode`, and confirming that
it runs correctly, just run:

```
sudo systemctl enable /home/pi/griode/griode.service
sudo systemctl start griode
```

Griode will start, and it will be automatically restarted when the
Pi reboots.

If it doesn't start, or if you want to see what's going on:

```
sudo systemctl status griode
sudo journalctl -u griode
```


## Bugs

- If you keep a note pressed while switching to another gridget,
  the note will continue to play. This is almost by design.
- If you keep a note pressed while stopping recording, it might
  record a zero-length notes.
- If a sync is triggered while notes are pressed, it might result
  in zero-length notes.
